    <h1>June</h1>
    <p>Kathryn Has Graduated High School!!!!<br>

<br> A great time to be alive!! You got your wisdom teeth out and started watching the Newton's house, and it felt like we were an old couple already. <br>
It was officially summer, which we started off with 21 savage. Volleyball season had ended. It was now Duke Kathryn time. <br>
I went to New York, you went to Boston, and we said goodbye to Jack. <br>
Safari Golf, beach days, and infinite time with my baby. <br> 
A busy but fun month :)</p>
