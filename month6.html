    <h1>July!!</h1>
    <p>Present day :) I couldn't be happier with you. <br>
Even though I lost my car, seeing how you have responded to it and still loving me & even driving more - it doesn't go unnoticed. I'm so thankful I have someone that loves me so much :) <br>
I know we've had stupid arguments recently and really just a lot of dumb stuff, but I know we're going to get married. <br> We're growing together and as long as we communicate like we are and continue loving we will make it there. <br>
I love you so so much Kathryn. You're my ray of sunshine. I wake up every morning so happy knowing its another day I get to love you. <br>
Happy 6 Months :))) <br>
