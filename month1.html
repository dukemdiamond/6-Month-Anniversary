    <h1>Jan/Feb</h1>
    <p>January 29th, 2024, I asked you out by your car on your way out from my house.<br>
I didn't plan it out - I just did it. I looked at you and I knew.<br><br> 
I realized what you deserve. You deserved all the love and kindness you poured out for me. I'm so happy you stuck by my side Kathryn.<br> You're all I have ever needed.<br>
Anyways... This first month of us together was so fun! We went on our NYC trip, did some things for the first time :wink: :wink: , spent so much time together and even said..<br>
 I love you!</p>
