    <p>MAY!!! You promposed to me, took me to Dave & Busters, and kept coming to all my volleyball games. <br> 
I had my senior night, you were right there with me.<br> Then your prom (SO FUN!!). <br> I graduated, of course you were right there with me! <br>
We both finished school this month, and we started to hang out like everyday. Began having real sleepovers too...<br>
Great memories in this month! </p>
